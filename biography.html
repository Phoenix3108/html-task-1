    <h1>INTRO</h1>
    <p id="intro">Gennady Korotkevich (Belarusian: Генадзь Караткевіч, Hienadź Karatkievič, Russian: Геннадий Короткевич; born 25 September 1994) is a Belarusian competitive sport programmer who has won major international competitions since the age of 11, as well as numerous national competitions. Widely regarded as one of the greatest competitive sport programmers of all time, his top accomplishments include six consecutive gold medals in the International Olympiad in Informatics[1] as well as the world championship in the 2013 and 2015 International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals. As of October 2023, Korotkevich is the highest-rated programmer on CodeChef,[2] Topcoder,[3] AtCoder [jp][4] and HackerRank.[5] On 30th August 2024, he achieved a historic rating of 4009 on Codeforces, becoming the first to break the 4000 barrier.[6] He was the highest-rated programmer on Codeforces[7] until 20 January 2024.</p>
    <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
    <p id="bio">Korotkevich was born in Gomel (Homiel), southeastern Belarus. His parents, Vladimir and Lyudmila Korotkevich, are programmers in the mathematics department at Francysk Skaryna Homiel State University. At age 6, he became interested in his parents' work. When he was 8, his father designed a children's game he could use to learn programming.[8]

His mother consulted departmental colleague Mikhail Dolinsky, who gave Korotkevich a small book to read. Dolinsky, one of the top computer science teachers in Belarus, recalled, "A month went by, and then another one... No news from Gena. Then suddenly Lyudmila comes by and brings me a programming notebook: when summer and football were over, her son sat at the computer. As a second-grader at a national competition, he took second place, which gained him an automatic entry into a technical university without taking any entrance exams. Somehow he solved the problem of a body immersed in water. At that time, Gena didn't even know about Archimedes' principle of buoyancy."[8]

Korotkevich first gained global attention when he qualified for the 2006 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) at the age of 11, a world record by a large margin.[9]

He took the silver medal at his first IOI event and received gold medals from 2007 to 2012.[1] To date, he is the most successful competitor in IOI's history.[10]

At the 2009 IOI in Plovdiv, the then 14-year-old Korotkevich said of his success, "I try various [strategies], and one of them is the right one. I am no genius. I am simply good at it." He said he spent no more than three to four hours each day at the computer, and his preferred hobbies are football and table tennis.[11]

In the fall of 2012, he moved to Russia to attend ITMO University. In the summer of 2013, he helped ITMO defeat Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Tokyo to win the 37th International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals, held in St. Petersburg.[12] He also won the annual Google Code Jam from 2014 to 2020.

In a 2014 interview, Korotkevich said he was unsure of his career plans after graduation, saying he'd focus on his education and possibly go into science.[9]

In a 2017 interview, Korotkevich said he had received job offers from Google and Yandex, but that he had turned them down and would instead continue with his degree in computer science at ITMO.[13]

In 2019, Korotkevich was a PhD student at ITMO.[14]

On August 30th, 2024, Korotkevich became the first to break the 4000 Elo barrier on Codeforces.[6] Before this, the highest rating category was thought to be "Legendary Grandmaster" achieved at rating 3000, for which users would be rewarded by having the first letter of their handle turn black and the rest of the handle red. On August 30th, Korotkevich revealed the rating category above "Legendary Grandmaster": the category "Tourist", named after Korotkevich's own handle. The handle coloring of this category is an inverted "Legendary Grandmaster" Nutella coloring—the first letter red and the rest of the name black. Only one user has reached the category "Tourist" after Korotkevich; that is "jiangly", whose category is now "Jiangly."</p>
